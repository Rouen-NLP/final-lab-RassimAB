  In this project we are interessted in a database that contain different type of documents in an image and text file formats collected from five big Americans tobacco groups, so the U.S. government sued them for amassing large benefit by lying about the dangers of cigarettes. 
  
  The goal of this project is to make an automatic classification of Documents types in order to facilitate the exploitation of these documents by the lawyers.
  
  So first we will undertake and analysis of the data present in our database, then we define a process for creating the traning, validation, and test bases so we can propose different models and test different classification algorithmes, and finally we will discuss about the results of these models and future works.
